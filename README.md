# IXL Project

In railway signalling, an interlocking is a set of signals, switches, controller(s) and sensors that allows train to move without risks of collision or derailment.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the possibility of making a simple and generic interlocking controller using relatively recent technology (ie, not [invented 200 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay)).
